            <p>
              Welcome to StudySwap. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the StudySwap
              platform, including any content, functionality, and services offered on or through studyswap.com (the
              "Service").
            </p>
            <p>
              By registering with us or by using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with
              any part of the terms, you may not access the Service.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. Academic Integrity</h2>
            <p>
              StudySwap is designed to facilitate peer-to-peer learning and collaboration. Users are expected to adhere
              to the following academic integrity guidelines:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>
                Helpers should provide guidance, explanations, and support that helps requesters understand concepts and
                develop their own solutions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Requesters should not use StudySwap to circumvent academic requirements or to submit work that is not
                their own.
              </li>
              <li>
                All users must comply with their educational institution's academic integrity policies and honor codes.
              </li>
              <li>
                StudySwap reserves the right to remove content or suspend accounts that violate academic integrity
                principles.
              </li>
            </ul>
